# If you delete this file, it will be recreated with the default aliases.
# The first word of each line is the alias, and the rest is the command.
# Lines starting with # are ignored.

# The aliases for ss, ls, and ll are defined by default and must be overridden to be disabled.
# They are shown below to demonstrate the formatting.
